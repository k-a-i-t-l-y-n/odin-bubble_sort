# odin-bubble_sort
This repo is my solution to the Odin's Project's bubble sort exercise.

I developed a method that takes an Integer array and returns the array sorted in ascending order. The algorithm I used to sort is based on the bubble sort algorithm.

Example
-------
[4, 1, 4, 6, 0, 3, -9, 78] -> [-9, 0, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6, 78]
